## Second Chapter 

This is my project developed on the Bootcamp of Altimetrik Become a Front End Developer 2nd edition. There is a long way to go yet, but I'm really happy with the result so far. I learn a lot, and when i say al lot is A LOT indeed 

I made the pages from scratch form Figma design, with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. The first page has a Log in working with Json server for authentication. The second page is a searching game platform, with more than 3.500 games!

I let here two snapshots to see how it looks like :eyes:
